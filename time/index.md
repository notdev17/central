## **Discussion Summary part A:** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed that we would politely let each other know if someone exercises too much control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or isn't participating enough. We also agreed that if there is inclement weather or someone isn't feeling good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that we would use "Discord" for the people(s) not showing up to the meeting as it has chat and a webcam feature.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We attempted to set up a domain but decided it would be easier to use github pages as a project website.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to continue the rest of the meeting Thursday the 12th after class.

## **Discussion Summary Part B:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We set this meeting to finish the user stories assignment and also talk about what features we need to still complete for our
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; website. We came up with a couple of user stories and attached some business rules to them. We went over what we would bring to next meeting for paper prototyping.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also started a task matrix for the next week in order to track duties and split them amongst ourselves as well. The rest of the meeting was discussing what
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our next meetings agenda would be and who would be the facilitator (Daylen) and minute-taker (Michelle).
