## __**Discussion Summary part A:**__ 

We discussed that we would politely let each other know if someone exercises too much control
or isn't participating enough. We also agreed that if there is inclement weather or someone isn't feeling good
that we would use "Discord" for the people(s) not showing up to the meeting as it has chat and a webcam feature.
We attempted to set up a domain but decided it would be easier to use github pages as a project website.
We are going to continue the rest of the meeting Thursday the 12th after class.

## __**Discussion Summary Part B:**__

We set this meeting to finish the user stories assignment and also talk about what features we need to still complete for our
website. We came up with a couple of user stories and attached some business rules to them. We went over what we would bring to next meeting for paper prototyping.
We also started a task matrix for the next week in order to track duties and split them amongst ourselves as well. The rest of the meeting was discussing what
our next meetings agenda would be and who would be the facilitator (Daylen) and minute-taker (Michelle).
