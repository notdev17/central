# *Terminology and points to become familiar with github*
   * [MASTER BRANCH] IS THE BRANCH THAT WE DO NOT MESS WITH UNTIL CHANGES ARE APPROVED BY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS.

   * [Branches] - branches are to help version control, so we can make copies of *the Master Branch*. 
     - Furthermore, we use these branches       (seperate versions) to make changes that we can possibly get it approved by other team members.
   * DONT MAKE CHANGES TO THE MASTER BRANCH WITHOUT TEAM APPORVAL, or atleast try not to lol
   * [Pulls] - we pull from versions/branches to your local machine, so that we can make changes and commit them under a new version/branch
   * [Requests] - https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ if you want to make a change to the master branch then make a pull request and make changes to the pull request.
