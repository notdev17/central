# GitHub References:
	Below are references and terminology for github


## My preferences for connecting to github:
  * MobaXTerm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ //this is what I primarily use
  * GitBash: https://git-scm.com/downloads //most old school
  * Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/ //github made their own client, its pretty pretty
  * BitBucket is also useful as a platform to access github

## Terminology and points to become familiar with github*
   [MASTER BRANCH] IS THE BRANCH THAT WE DO NOT MESS WITH UNTIL CHANGES ARE APPROVED BY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS.


   [Branches] - branches are to help version control, so we can make copies of *the Master Branch*. 
     - Furthermore, we use these branches (seperate versions) to make changes that we can possibly get it approved by other team members


   DONT MAKE CHANGES TO THE MASTER BRANCH WITHOUT TEAM APPORVAL, or atleast try not to lol
   

   [Pulls] - we pull from versions/branches to your local machine, so that we can make changes and commit them under a new version/branch
   

   [Requests] - https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ if you want to make a change to the master branch then make a pull request and make changes to the pull request.
