## My preferences for connecting to github:
  * MobaXTerm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ //this is what I primarily use
  * GitBash: https://git-scm.com/downloads //most old school
  * Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/ //github made their own client, its pretty pretty
  * BitBucket is also useful as a platform to access github

  * Another option is GitKraken, which you can get a 1 year pro account through the github students pack:
